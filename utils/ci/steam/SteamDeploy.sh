# STEAM DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT FOR NAEV
# Requires SteamCMD to be installed within a Github Actions ubuntu-latest runner.

# Written by Jack Greiner (ProjectSynchro on Github: https://github.com/ProjectSynchro/)

# This script should be run after downloading all build artefacts
# If -n is passed to the script, a nightly build will be generated
# and uploaded to Steam
#
# Pass in [-d] [-n] (set this for nightly builds) [-n] (set this for CI testing) -v <VERSIONPATH> (Sets path of the VERSION file.) -s <SCRIPTROOT> (Sets path to look for additional steam scripts.) -t <TEMPPATH> (Steam build artefact location) -o <STEAMPATH> (Steam dist output directory)
