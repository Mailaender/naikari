"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system
#. hook warm reception to player landing
#. If player didn't accept the mission, the battle's still on, but player has no stake.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. How the Battle ends:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after the raiders start to flee declare victory
#. Call ships back to base
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing

#. Calculate the route, distance, jumps, time limit, and priority
#. don't show mission on really close systems; they don't need you for short hops

#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?

#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.

#. Then use Forma:setTask() to control the fleader
#. -usage is:
#. Forma:new(fleet,"formation",combat_dist, preferred_fleet_leader)
#. --combat_dist is the distance from the fleet leader to an enemy before the formation breaks and ships attack.
#. --preferred_fleet_leader is the ship you want to be leader. if that ship dies, the scripts hands leadership to another ship.
#. -if formation or distance isn't provided, formation will be "circle" and distance will be 3000
#. Control the fleet's movements by controlling the fleet leader, or "fleader".
#.
#. example:
#. my_fleet = pilot.add("Pirate Hyena Pack")
#. my_fleet = Forma:new(my_fleet,"echelon left",1500)
#. my_fleet:setTask("goto",vec2.new(0,0))

#. First define the base object. There are no default values, I only wrote in the variables for reader reference.
#. The functions below that start with Forma: are all elements of the Forma table above.
#. Every such function is automatically passed the Forma object they are called on.
#. This object is referenced as "self".
#. Create a new object based on the Forma "class".

#. Combat flag, used in the controlling function.
#. Death function. Removes a pilot from a fleet and reorganizes the fleet if necessary.
#. This will automatically reorganize the table, so there won't be any entries for pilots that have been removed.

#. We need to update the fleet's organization if the leader got killed.
#. Update the ship count if the formation is "buffer".
#. Jump hook. Ensures the entire fleet jumps if the fleader jumps.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Jumping out is the same as dying, for our purpose; we need to not run this before the if statement.

#. Rotate spokes by 90 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 4 positions.
#. buffer formation
#. Buffer logic. Consecutive arcs emanating from the fleader. Stored as polar coordinates.
#. Different radii for each class.
#. Need to keep track of positions already iterated through.
#. For readability.
#. If there's only one ship in this specific class...
#. The angle needs to be zero.
#. If there's more than one ship in each class...
#. ..the angle rotates from -45 degrees to 45 degrees, assigning coordinates at even intervals.
#. Update the count
#. Assign the radius, defined above.
#. vee formation
#. The vee formation forms a v, with the fleader at the apex, and the arms extending in front.
#. Arms start at a 45 degree angle.
#. First ship distance.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. Flip the arms between -45 and 45 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 2 positions.
#. wedge formation
#. The wedge formation forms a v, with the fleader at the apex, and the arms extending out back.
#. First ship distance.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. Flip the arms between 135 and 215 degrees.

#. Formation control function. A wrapper again.

#. Call the wrapper, not this function.
#. combat. mmmm.
#. Includes the player as an enemy to be iterated over.
#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to separate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
#. Assign the coordinates.
#. Remember, there is no need to check if a pilot exists, because we've already made sure all pilots exist.
#. Clear orders.
#. Computing the direction using a pd controller
#. Make mon capitan travel at 5 below the slow speed, so other ships can catch up.
#. Logic for fleet leader goes here. For now, let's allow the fleader to act according to the regular AI.

"    Of course, please note that this is an incomplete game. You will "
"encounter dead ends to storylines, missing storylines, and possibly even "
"some bugs, although we try to keep those to a minimum of course. So be "
"prepared for some rough edges for the time being. That said, we are working "
"on this game every day and hope to one day finish this massive project on "
"our hands. Perhaps you could become one of us, who knows?\n"
"    For more information about the game and its development state, take a "
"look at naev.org; it has all the relevant links. And again, thank you for "
