# NAIKARI CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

* Changed the land and takeoff music to be the same as ambient music.
* Adjusted balancing of ships a bit, most noticeably changing the
  Kestrel's two large fighter bay slots to medium fighter bay slots.
* All ships now come with pre-installed weapons when you buy them, not
  just your first ship.
* The warning shown when warping into a system with a volatile nebula
  now shows exactly how much damage your shield and armor take from it,
  rather than only showing the direct volatility rating.
* AI pilots now launch fighters if they have fighter bays.
* Several new fighter bays have been added (mostly miniaturized versions
  of existing fighter bays, but also three variations of a Shark
  fighter bay).
* Hired escorts that are created on restricted planets and stations now
  pilot factional military ships.
