# NAIKARI CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

* Changed the land and takeoff music to be the same as ambient music.
* Changed the rewards for Trader Escort missions, avoiding inflated
  multi-million credit rewards.
* Adjusted balancing of ships and outfits a bit, most noticeably
  changing the Kestrel's two large fighter bay slots to medium fighter
  bay slots.
* All ships now come with pre-installed weapons when you buy them, not
  just your first ship.
* The warning shown when warping into a system with a volatile nebula
  now shows exactly how much damage your shield and armor take from it,
  rather than only showing the direct volatility rating.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

Initial release.
