We're trying to evacuate some of ours stranded in Doranthex, a Dvaered-owned system. Security is tight and we just can't find an opening. I need someone to distract the Dvaered forces so we can give them more of a fighting chance. You'll basically need to travel to the {system} system and wreak havoc there so that the Dvaereds go after you and not the soldiers trying to escape Doranthex.
