# NAIKARI CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0

* Changed the land and takeoff music to be the same as ambient music.
* Adjusted balancing of outfits and ships, most noticeably changing the
  Kestrel's two large fighter bay slots to medium fighter bay slots and
  making the Huntsman torpedo much stronger.
* All ships now come with pre-installed weapons when you buy them, not
  just your first ship.
* The warning shown when warping into a system with a volatile nebula
  now shows exactly how much damage your shield and armor take from it,
  rather than only showing the direct volatility rating.
* AI pilots now launch fighters if they have fighter bays.
* Several new fighter bays have been added (mostly miniaturized versions
  of existing fighter bays, but also three variations of a Shark
  fighter bay).
* Hired escorts that are created on restricted planets and stations now
  pilot factional military ships.
* The Info window's missions tab now displays the current objective
  according to the OSD.
* Logo now lights up red for Autism Acceptance Month, turns into a
  rainbow for Queer Pride Month, and turns into aromantic pride colors
  for Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week.
* Asteroid Scanner now always shows you scan information for asteroids
  you can see, rather than only after you've targeted them.
* Replaced Improved Refrigeration Cycle with the Rotary Turbo Modulator,
  which does the opposite of what the Improved Refrigeration Cycle did
  and serves as an equivalent to the Power Regulation Override outfit
  for turrets.
* Instant mode weapons now show up on the weapon bar in the Brushed GUI.
* Ship Stealing mission now allows stealing of non-designated targets,
  at the cost of having to pay for the entire value of the ship (meaning
  it can't be used to make credits, it can only be used to steal
  particular ships you want to add to your collection). If it fails, it
  keeps running so you can steal a ship of your choice instead, and the
  OSD message changes to note this.
* Adjusted how much money ships carry to hopefully make illegal piracy
  more rewarding and make pirating pirates less rewarding, while also
  adding variety to piracy (some factions carry a lot of credits, some
  carry very little).
* Pirates no longer have a one-way hidden jump to Collective space
  (which served no purpose and was essentially just a death trap).
* Adjusted speed and size range of background nebulae and stars so they
  look nicer.
* Ship Stealing targets now lose most of their ammo in addition to armor
  and battery, and their armor regeneration is now disabled.
* Added a limit to mercenary group size in systems with low paying
  faction presence.
* Normalized some wonky presence costs, which in particular prevents
  Za'lek drones from outnumbering pirates in systems where they're
  supposed to have lower presence than them.
* Added a new set of stations and hidden jumps to help pirates get to
  Sirius space.
* The Brushed and Slim GUIs now hide the radar while the overlay is
  open.

## 0.1.3

* Fixed a bug which prevented the Drunkard mission from starting up.

## 0.1.2

* Properly fixed a segfault in 0.1.0. Version 0.1.1 attempted a fix, but
  the fix turned out to be faulty and led to breakage.

## 0.1.1

* Faulty release.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
